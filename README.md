# easy_car_v1

This project (still under development) intends to help you in order to turn your car to act like a modern vehicle. 
The main goals of this project are:
                 
                 -Control vehicles remotely or locally
                 -Improve security (by connecting NodMcu to the internet,vehicales are going to exchange data with eachother to void accidents as much as possible)
                 -Autonomate the vehicle using IOT
                 -Reduce cost by using minimal electronic components

## The components that are used:
                           
                           -NodMcu8266
                           -Uln2003
                           -Diodes
                           -5v Relays
                           -Buck converter
 
## P.S

 -You can upload pre-compiled file 'easycar.bin' or 'easycar.ino' using arduino IDE.

 -You can also use pre-designed PCB using KICAD

 -After the code is uploaded via usb you can use OTA to upload it next time. *** Type your IP address followed by http://admin:admin@Your IP:81/update ***
